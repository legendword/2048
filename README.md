# 2048
Replicate of the original 2048 game made by Legendword.

This is an implementation of the 2048 game using HTML, CSS, Javascript. jQuery and Bootstrap are used.

I used jQuery's `.animate` method to create animations, and LocalStorage for storing high score since it's much easier than Cookies.
